Aquifer Pressure Modeling Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for modeling, analyzing, and forecasting aquifer pressure dynamics in response to water extraction and recharge scenarios. The model is designed to support sustainable water management decisions for stakeholders such as farmers, local businesses, iwi, and councils.

## Features
- **ODE-Based Model:** Simulates aquifer pressure using a physically motivated ordinary differential equation, incorporating extraction, recharge, and slow drainage effects.
- **Data-Driven Calibration:** Parameters are estimated and optimized using real aquifer pressure and extraction data, with benchmarking against analytical solutions to ensure model stability and accuracy.
- **Scenario Forecasting:** Simulates future aquifer pressure under multiple stakeholder-driven extraction scenarios, including constant, increasing, halted, and staged recovery extraction rates.
- **Uncertainty Analysis:** Quantifies the impact of parameter uncertainty on model forecasts, supporting robust decision-making.
- **Visualization:** Provides clear plots for historical data, model fit, scenario forecasts, and uncertainty distributions.

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Reads historical aquifer pressure and extraction data from CSV files.
2. **Model Development:** Defines and benchmarks the ODE model, ensuring numerical accuracy.
3. **Parameter Calibration:** Fits model parameters to observed data using curve fitting and manual calibration.
4. **Scenario Simulation:** Projects future aquifer pressure for different stakeholder scenarios.
5. **Uncertainty Quantification:** Analyzes the effect of parameter uncertainty on forecasts.
6. **Summary and Reporting:** Outputs key findings, model performance metrics, and actionable recommendations.

## Key Results
- Achieved a reduction in model error by over 1×10¹³ through parameter optimization.
- Provided actionable recommendations, with the council’s staged extraction reduction plan projected to restore aquifer pressure to 2000s levels by 2070.
- Quantified parameter uncertainty, reinforcing the robustness of the recommended management strategy.
